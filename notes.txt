## uChicago Requirements:
- Minimum 25 commits
- DONE Link Database via MongoDB
- DONE Add player Login via BCrypt
- DONE MongoDB collection connection (Game --> Players)
- Socket / MultiPlayer option
- Deploy!

## Notes for Next Update:
-- Basic setup for socket.io complete!
-- decide which "server" will drive what actions (NextJS or Websocket)
    -- probably nextJS for routing pages, and webSocket for creating games/rooms
-- combine 2 players into a "room" with socket.io when you createGame
    -- learn about "handshake" in socket...?
    -- https://socket.io/docs/v4/rooms/

-- Add checkMove logic 
-- Add 'resign' button and logic to test GameResults logging
-- Deploy on Firebase (better than Vercel for gameState management)
#### Embelishments

-- Need to more securely authenticate users and re-direct to gamepage
    maybe add OAuth and next-auth for google sign-in? 


HUGE GAMEPLAY ERROR --> when a koya is created, all following seeds are ROOTS...
UPDATE: have narrowed this error down to being in the actuall P1/P2SeedStack kept by the
gameBoard. The seed at index 0 in the SeedStacks is being set to a root before placement


## In Progress
- After a koya is created, all the following seeds for that player are PLACED as roots.
