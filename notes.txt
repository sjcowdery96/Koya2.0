## uChicago Requirements:
- Minimum 25 commits
- DONE Link Database via MongoDB
- DONE Add player Login via BCrypt
- MongoDB collection connection (GameResults --> Players)
- Deploy!

## Notes for Next Update:
FIXED THE FRIGGIN CONTEXT ERROR!! WOHOO!

Next challenge -- fixing the create game routes to create and start game


-- Utilize PlayerContext and create game API routes to grab players to begin a game
-- Add 'resign' button and logic to test GameResults logging
-- Finish connecting GameResults to Players
-- Deploy on Firebase (better than Vercel for gameState management)
-- Need to more securely authenticate users and re-direct to gamepage
    maybe add OAuth and next-auth for google sign-in? 


--Linking Database GameResults/Player properly using $lookup:
gemini: how do you use $lookup in mongodb/mongoose in typscript?
could allow you to build functions to manipulate the database to
return winning record, calculate player rating, etc.


HUGE GAMEPLAY ERROR --> when a koya is created, all following seeds are ROOTS...
UPDATE: have narrowed this error down to being in the actuall P1/P2SeedStack kept by the
gameBoard. The seed at index 0 in the SeedStacks is being set to a root before placement


## In Progress
- After a koya is created, all the following seeds for that player are PLACED as roots.


## Finished!
small update -- directly sent context into the API to create-game
HUGE WIN -- fixed context for logged in player
encrypted passwords into database with bcrypt
connected MongoDB for Player
fixed trunks increasing size every turn
solved doubling up pieces and playerMove errors
createKoya object and initial create koya logic
