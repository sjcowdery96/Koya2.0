## uChicago Requirements:
- Minimum 25 commits
- DONE Link Database via MongoDB
- DONE Add player Login via BCrypt

- MongoDB collection connection (GameResults --> Players)
- Deploy!

## Notes for Next Update:

-- Finish connecting GameResults to Players
-- Deploy on Firebase (better than Vercel for gameState management)
--Need to more securely authenticate users and re-direct to gamepage
    maybe add OAuth and next-auth for google sign-in? 


--Linking Database GameResults/Player properly using $lookup:
gemini: how do you use $lookup in mongodb/mongoose in typscript?
could allow you to build functions to manipulate the database to
return winning record, calculate player rating, etc.


HUGE GAMEPLAY ERROR --> when a koya is created, all following seeds are ROOTS...
UPDATE: have narrowed this error down to being in the actuall P1/P2SeedStack kept by the
gameBoard. The seed at index 0 in the SeedStacks is being set to a root before placement


## In Progress
- After a koya is created, all the following seeds for that player are PLACED as roots.


## Finished!
