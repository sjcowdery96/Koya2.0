## uChicago Requirements:
- Minimum 25 commits
- DONE Link Database via MongoDB
- DONE Add player Login via BCrypt
- MongoDB collection connection (GameResults --> Players)
- Deploy!

## Notes for Next Update:
-- Data is writing to the database! Now add multiPlayer with Socket
    -- create a new test project of Tic Tac Toe for online multi-player learning
-- Add checkMove logic 


-- Add 'resign' button and logic to test GameResults logging
-- Deploy on Firebase (better than Vercel for gameState management)
-- Need to more securely authenticate users and re-direct to gamepage
    maybe add OAuth and next-auth for google sign-in? 


HUGE GAMEPLAY ERROR --> when a koya is created, all following seeds are ROOTS...
UPDATE: have narrowed this error down to being in the actuall P1/P2SeedStack kept by the
gameBoard. The seed at index 0 in the SeedStacks is being set to a root before placement


## In Progress
- After a koya is created, all the following seeds for that player are PLACED as roots.
