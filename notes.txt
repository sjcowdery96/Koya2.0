## uChicago Requirements:
- Minimum 25 commits
- DONE Link Database via MongoDB
- DONE Add player Login via BCrypt
- MongoDB collection connection (GameResults --> Players)
- Deploy!

## Notes for Next Update:
need to move all the class functions into the server and append the database
    EXAMPLE: TypeError: newGame.Spaces[location].addPiece is not a function
    push() needs to become:
    MyModel.findByIdAndUpdate(documentId, {
        $push: { arrayOfElements: elementToAdd }, // Specify the array field and element
    })

Create game successfully linked to Database
Next challenge is making the GameBoard reading and writing to the database!


-- Add 'resign' button and logic to test GameResults logging
-- Deploy on Firebase (better than Vercel for gameState management)
-- Need to more securely authenticate users and re-direct to gamepage
    maybe add OAuth and next-auth for google sign-in? 


HUGE GAMEPLAY ERROR --> when a koya is created, all following seeds are ROOTS...
UPDATE: have narrowed this error down to being in the actuall P1/P2SeedStack kept by the
gameBoard. The seed at index 0 in the SeedStacks is being set to a root before placement


## In Progress
- After a koya is created, all the following seeds for that player are PLACED as roots.


## Finished!
connected game data -- consolidated GameResults/Gamedata into Game
connected players, gameResults and GameData
small update -- directly sent context into the API to create-game
HUGE WIN -- fixed context for logged in player
encrypted passwords into database with bcrypt
connected MongoDB for Player
fixed trunks increasing size every turn
solved doubling up pieces and playerMove errors
createKoya object and initial create koya logic
set branches is working!
Basic scoreboard
Opening game logic complete
API routes added
Basic UI -- WOHOO! big milestone for logic testing
Gameboard object
finish sendBranch in Space Object
added Gameboard
Space.checkKoya()
Piece Object
Branch Object
